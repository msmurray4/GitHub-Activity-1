Once upon a time, a man named James went to the market in order to get milk for his morning cereal. On his way to the store he ran into an old friend named Jessica.
Jessica warned James that there was no more milk at the grocery store that he was going to, and he would actually have to go to another town in order to get milk for
his morning cereal. This made James angry, because this is the third time in a month james has had to travel to the other town for milk.
